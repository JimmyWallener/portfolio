        <h6>About me</h6>
        <p>
          My name is Jimmy Wallener, a passionate junior developer with
          experience in both frontend and backend development. I am currently
          studying system development with a focus on C/C++ at Chas Academy,
          having previously completed programs in both frontend and Java
          development. My journey as a developer has provided me with a broad
          understanding of various programming languages, tools, and
          technologies. I also have a solid background in leadership and
          operations from my previous career in retail.
