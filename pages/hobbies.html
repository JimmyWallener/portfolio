        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>
            I have always been interested in technology and computers, which is
            why I decided to pursue a career in programming. I enjoy working on
            both frontend and backend development, and I am always looking for
            new projects to work on.

          <h3>Video Games</h3>
          <p>
            Video games have been a big part of my life since I was a kid. I
            enjoy playing a wide variety of games, from action and adventure to
            role-playing and strategy games. Recently, I have been playing a lot
            of indie games and especially enjoy games like Satisfactory and
            Factorio.

          <h3>Reading</h3>
          <p>
            Reading is a great way to relax and unwind after a long day. I enjoy
            reading a wide variety of genres, from science fiction and fantasy
            to historical fiction and non-fiction. I am always looking for new
            books to add to my collection. My latest read was Rewire Your Brain
            by John B. Arden.
